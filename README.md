# By-Tor's Burger Builder

A React app for creating, ordering and storing orders for burgers.

The app users authentication in order to guard specific routes, as well as ensuring users are only able to view orders history that relates specifically to them. This app also makes use of Redux for state management purposes.

This was created using HTML, CSS and React, as well as Firebase for storing and retrieving orders. API calls were made using Axios.
